More broadly, it includes any activity involved in the <br>
        organization of waste management from production to final treatment.</p></div>

            <li>Singapore uses the waste to Build man-made islands</li> <br>
            <li>We bin around 50m tonnes of electrical waste globally every year. That’s nearly 4 <br>million double decker buses worth of old computer equipment, TVs, stereos and <br> kitchen appliances, stretching to the moon more than 3 times over!</li> <br>
            <li>We throw away 7.2 million tonnes of food every year, and more than half of it’s <br> perfectly edible. Meanwhile, 1 in 7 people across the world don't have enough to eat</li> <br>
            <li> At Christmas, as much as 83 square kilometres of wrapping paper will end up in UK bins when it could have been recycled instead. <br> That’s the same size as Sunderland!</li><br>
